# Gradio API Server

This server acts as a proxy to the `trellis-community/TRELLIS` Gradio application, exposing its API endpoints via a standard RESTful interface.

## Setup

1.  **Save the files**: Save the `server.js` and `package.json` files from above into a new project directory.

2.  **Install dependencies**: Open your terminal in the project directory and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Server

To start the server, run one of the following commands:

-   For production:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
-   For development (with automatic restarts on file changes):
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## API Usage Examples

You can interact with the server using any HTTP client, like `curl` or Postman.

#### Example: Get a random seed

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "randomize_seed": true, "seed": 42 }' \
  http://localhost:3000/get_seed
